This is the start of how I am spending my time to learn and build a working project with data science. I will document all this in Git hub as my journey begains

Some starting and structures that I will follow as we progress, 

  1. approach Pomodoro study technique (25 mins per cycle and 5 mins breaks)
  2. Feyman concept for learning -- a short video will be made to explain what was achieve daily this will also include teaching on the concepts learnt
  3. Plan ---> Learn ----> Build ----> Explain will be the process to follow 
 
 So lets do the first planning concepts of Data science and how this can help in clarity for the project. 
 
 Document can and will be uploaded to github and a video to my gogole drive for sharing. day 1 22 Dec 2021
